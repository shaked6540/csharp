# Features
- Run c# code form the command line
- No semicolons needed
- Load external assemblies
- Save scripts
- Single executeable, ready to run out of the box
- Supports Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android (Instructions to install on android will be at the bottom)
## Built-in functions
### help
`help` is a function that takes any object or a [`Type`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type?view=netcore-3.1) and prints all its methods, properties, fields and events. It's useful because there is no auto completion in the command line, and sometimes its faster to just type `help(typeof(int))` than to open the documentaion.

### variables
`variables` is a function that prints all the variables that exist in the current script session and their values.

# Installing
You don't need to do anything special to install `csharp`, just go to [the actions page](https://github.com/shaked6540/csharp/actions), select the newest entry, download the version that matches your needs then extract it and run it. If you have .NET Core 3.1 installed, select the framework dependent version, if not, select the self contained version.

Or build it by yourself and drop it in a folder. 

I recommend adding the executable location to `PATH`.

[Here is how to add a value to `PATH` on Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059)

[Here is how to add a value to `PATH` on Windows](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/features/test-runners/add-path-environment-variables)

# Building
1. Clone the project using git
2. Open a commandline and run `dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r win-x64`.
Replace `--self-contained false` to `--self-contained true` if you wish to build a self contained version of the program.
Replace `win-x64` with your platform if you build for an OS other than windows.

# Configuring

`csharp` can be configured using a config file, simply place a 'Config.json' file in the same folder as the exectueable and add the following properties.

Note: you don't need to add all of them, they are all optional 

- Assemblies: An array of strings containing file names of assemblies that will be loaded when `csharp` runs. Usually, there will be a bunch of dll files here. The assemblies must be in the same folder as the executeable
- Namespaces: An array of strings containing names of namespaces that will be included when running `csharp`. This is equivalent to "using x;"
- BeforeScriptFile: A string containing a path to file that will be loaded before user input. This is useful if you want to exectue something every time you start `csharp`, for example, creating a variable that holds the names of all the files in the current directory
- SaveScripts: A boolean to indicate whether the running code will be saved to a .txt file or not.
- SavedScriptsLocation: A string containing a path to a folder where the scripts will be saved. If this property is missing but `SaveScripts` is set to true, it defaults to a folder called `Scripts` which will be created where the exectueable resides
- NewlinePrefix: A string indicating what prefix will be displayed when `csharp` prompts a user input. The default value is `"> "`
- MultilineCodeKeyword: A string indicating what value, when entered, will wait until the `EndKeyword` is inserted before exectuing the code. This means you will be able to insert as many new lines as you want without executing the code until `EndKeyword` is entered. The default value is `lines` 
- EndKeyword: A string indicating what value, when entered, will execute the code that was writtin since `MultilineCodeKeyword` was entered. If `MultilineCodeKeyword` was not entered prior to using this keyword, the program will exit. The default value is `end`



An example of a full `Config.json` file:
```json
{
    "Assemblies": ["MoreLinq.dll"],
    "Namespaces": ["MoreLinq","System.Text.Json"],
    "BeforeScriptFile": "D:\\csharp\\BeforeScript.cs",
    "SaveScripts": true,
    "SavedScriptsLocation": "D:\\csharp\\Scripts",
    "NewlinePrefix": "> ",
    "MultilineCodeKeyword": "lines",
    "EndKeyword": "end"
}
```

An example of a `BeforeScript.cs` (Note: semicolons are optional here too!) : 
```cs
public static void cw(object o) => Console.WriteLine(o);
var files = Directory.GetFiles(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory());
class MyClass
{
    public int myInt
    public string myString
    
    public MyClass(int myInt, string myString) 
    {
        this.myInt = myInt
        this.myString = myString
    }
    
    public void Print() 
    {
        cw($"{myInt} - {myString}")
    }
    
}

var myClass = new MyClass(5, "Hello")
myClass.Print()
```


# Installing on Android
1. Install [termux](https://termux.com/). 
2. Install ubunutu using [this guide](https://github.com/MFDGaming/ubuntu-in-termux)
3. (Optional) If you want to use the framework dependent build of the program, install .NET Core 3.1 from [here (32bit)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.302-linux-arm32-binaries) or [here (64bit)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.302-linux-arm64-binaries) and follow the instructions provided
4. Thats it! run the program. I recommend adding the executeable location to `PATH` so you don't need to navigate to it every time. I also recommend adding the `startubuntu.sh` script to `PATH` or create an alias for it in `.bashrc`
